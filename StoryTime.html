     <p font-size: 20px;">Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid a golden egg every day. The egg provided enough money
      for the farmer and his wife for their day-to-day needs. The farmer and his wife were happy for a long time. But one day, the
       farmer got an idea and thought, “Why should I take just one egg a day? Why can’t I take all of them at once and make a lot of
        money?”
        The foolish farmer’s wife also agreed and decided to cut the goose’s stomach for the eggs. As soon as they killed the bird
         and opened the goose’s stomach, to find nothing but guts and blood. The farmer, realizing his foolish mistake, cries over
          the lost resource! The English idiom “kill not the goose that lays the golden egg” was also derived from this classic
           story.

            <p>There were four friends who hated studying. They partied all night before their exams and planned to skip the 
            test by lying to the professor. So they went to the dean and told him that they had been to a wedding the previous 
            night and on their way back, they had a flat tire. They continued to say that they had to push the car all the way back,
            as they didn’t have a spare tire and hence, were not in a position to write the exam.
            The dean listened and agreed to let them take the test on a later date. Happy that they got a second chance, the four
            friends studied hard and were ready for the exam. On exam day, the dean asked the students to sit in separate
            classrooms, which the students agreed to.
            The examination paper had only two questions, for a total of 100 marks. The questions were thus:

    		Your name:
    		Which tire of the car burst:
    		<br>a) Front left  b) Front right  c) Rear left  d) Rear right

      <p> A farmer looking for a source of water for his farm bought a well from his neighbor. The neighbor was cunning, though, 
      and refused to let the farmer take water from the well. On asking why, he replied, “I sold the well to you, not the water”,
      and walked away. The distraught farmer didn’t know what to do. So he went to Birbal, a clever man and one of the nine
      courtiers of Emperor Akbar, for a solution.
      The emperor called the farmer and his neighbor and asked why the man was not letting the farmer draw water from the well. 
      The cunning man said the same thing again, “I sold the well, not the water. So he cannot take my water”.
      To this, Birbal replied, “All that sounds fine to me. But if you have sold the water and the water is yours, then you have 
      no business keeping your water in his well. Remove the water or use it all up immediately. If not the water will belong to 
      the owner of the well”.
      Realizing that he’s been tricked and taught his lesson, the man apologized and left.
